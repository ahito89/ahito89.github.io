A few months ago I decided that i want to start writing about development and other stuff running around through my head. After playing around with Ghost, Wordpress , Hakyll and Hugo; I decided that Hugo is the way to go for my needs. Github Pages is a nice free hosting place for small static sites, CircleCI is used for deployment and everything was up and running in a few hours with the nice Hugo-Zen theme made by Rakuishi.</description></item></channel></rss>
